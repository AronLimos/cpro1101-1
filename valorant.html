            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Valorant is a 5v5 multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) where one team attacks and the other
                    defends.
                    The main game mode, Search and Destroy, is very similar to CS:GO.
                    The attacking team's goal is to plant a bomb (called a spike) and have it detonate, while the
                    defending team tries to avoid the bomb by defusing it in condition with the timer. Regardless of
                    whether the spike is planted or not, if a squad is wiped out before any other victory condition is
                    met, the opposing squad will win.
